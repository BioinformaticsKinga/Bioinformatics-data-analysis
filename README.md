# Bioinformatics data analysis
This pipeline integrates several powerful bioinformatics tools to perform a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis, from quality control to functional annotation and differential expression analysis.

Summary of Workflow:

    Quality Control: Raw reads are assessed using FastQC.

    Read Trimming: Trimmomatic is used to trim adapter sequences and low-quality bases from reads.

    Transcriptome Assembly: Trinity assembles RNA-seq reads into transcript sequences.

    Expression Quantification: RSEM calculates transcript abundance from the assembled data.

    ORF Prediction: TransDecoder predicts coding sequences from the transcriptome.

    Functional Annotation: Transcripts are annotated using Trinotate and KOBAS, providing insights into gene function and pathways.

    Differential Expression: DESeq2, Limma-voom, and edgeR are used to detect differentially expressed genes across conditions.
